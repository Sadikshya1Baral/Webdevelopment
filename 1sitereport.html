      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p> This is the first time I have ever done coding .And this has been both challenging and fun for me . It has been one of the best oppurtunity to step in coding world.Though the website  I am making may not be a perfect or an atrractive site but this helped me a lot for my learning in basic webdevelopment. Since ,this was first time for me  in webdevelopment I was quite confused at the beginning with the assignment.My mind was blown out and had no idea for some time. Then I started to revise my course of webdevelopment before starting the assignment. After revising once I then started to work with my assignment.During working with the assignment there were a lot of ups and downs with the code.But all over that I got to learn many things which will surely help me in future.<br> <br> Coding is fun but finding errors then fixing them is quite time and effort consuming but that was all neccesary while working on web development. The main problem I faced during the assignment was choosing positions for contents, selecting color for background, coding some parts in the pages was also difficult.And surely main problem for me was satisfaction  with the work. Not being satisfied with color gradients,text positionings,text colors and having no idea what to do next gave a lot of headache.But after solving these all problems gave a big relief.And for surely design of the website was also a problem at the beginning. I wanted to keep the the site very simple and not much decorations. So I decided to use color gradients as background not any kind of photographs.<br> Though faced some problem and challenges but overall the experience was quite fun and fixing the problems  always kept motivated.
